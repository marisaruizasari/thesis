### Abstract

Over the past decade, gun violence has risen to the forefront of the American political and social agenda. Yet the story of American gun violence is often focused on mass shootings that while horrifyingly symbolic of the country’s gun crisis, represent a small fraction of firearm deaths every year. Weapons of Mass Injustice is a visual essay that highlights forms of gun violence often overlooked in media and policy discussions. The project examines the inequitable impacts of this violence and its connection to the criminalization of black and brown youth in the US. By offering a counter narrative to the myth of the American crime infested city, the visual essay asks readers to question their beliefs about the perpetrators of daily gun violence and the collective action taken by law enforcement, city governments and communities to bring about peace.
