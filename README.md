# Exercise 1: Research Question

## Urban Gun Violence in the US: what are the citywide benefits of alternative gun violence reduction strategies?

#### Research statement:
I'm visualizing outcomes from alternative urban gun violence reduction strategies in low-income communities of color ---> because I want to find out if these strategies have an impact on citywide crime ---> In order to help my reader understand why new strategies are needed to address the urban gun violence crisis in the US


# Outline

## Introduction to urban gun violence in the US


#### Types of gun violence in the US  - homicide, suicide, domestic violence, gun accidents

#### How do gun violence rates compare globally & across the US?

- US gun violence rates are much higher than other high income countries
- Urban gun violence rates are much higher than national averages

#### Who are the victims and perpetrators of urban gun violence?

- Urban gun violence disproportionately impacts low-income communities of color

	- Primarily young men of color

## What are traditional urban gun violence strategies, why haven't they worked, and what are the consequences?

#### Policing & carceral state,

- Broken windows theory, tough on crime approach, three strikes

#### Incarceration rates not correlated with crime rates, indicating that the tough on crime approach does not have the positive benefits of crime reduction

#### Mass incarceration, disproportionately impacting black and brown communities

#### Gun policy

## What are alternative strategies and how do they differ in their approach to gun violence reduction?

#### Walk through of models/approaches using examples of individual cases / "profiles"

- Cure Violence
- Advance Peace
- Ceasefire
- Others

#### What role does gun policy play in this? How do these approaches complement policy change? Why are they needed in addition to policy change?

## Have these alternative strategies had citywide impacts on urban gun violence?

#### Case studies and analysis of crime rates over time including homicide rates, gun assaults etc.

- Bay Area, Chicago, New York
- Comparison to national trends
- Impact on individuals involved in programs

#### What about trends in non-gun related crimes? Theft, car break ins etc.

## Conclusion

#### Recap of findings, key takeaways for reader
